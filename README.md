Sound Event Detection Using Deep Learning
==========================================



Description
-----------

A deep learning sound event detection model was trained to classify environmental sounds, specifically focusing on identifying particular urban sounds. An app was built with Streamlit that takes an audio file as an input and outputs the predicted class.


Dataset
--------------------

URBANSOUND8K dataset was downloaded and used. The dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music.
